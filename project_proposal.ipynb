    "   According to the World Health Organization, the leading cause of death worldwide is cardiovascular diseases (2021). However, heart disorders can be preventable, as research has revealed various risk factors in the development of heart disease. Yusuf et al. (2001) suggested that high blood pressure and increased LDL cholesterol levels show causal links to cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the presence of chest pain has been found to be associated with increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease (Robson et al., 2015), as well as ECT abnormalities which are suggestive of an increased risk of heart disease (Whincup, 1995). Other varibles, such as gender and age, contribute to risk factors (Mass & Appleman, 2010). \n",
    "    Using the Heart Disease Dataset from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, we will determine how accurately a classification model correctly predicts the presence of heart disease for a new observation. The classification model will use the following predictor varibles: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, resting ECT results, and presence of exercise-indudced angina.\n"
